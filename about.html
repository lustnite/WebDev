<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I’m a 31-year-old web developer from New Jersey with a passion for crafting seamless digital experiences. I graduated from Howard University with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science, and I’ve been immersed in the tech world ever since. </p>

<p>Whether I'm building websites or diving into new coding challenges, I’m always looking to learn and grow in the ever-evolving landscape of web development.
  Outside of work, I’m all about balance. I love making music, hitting the gym, and spending quality time with my friends and family. Whether it’s creating beats in my free time or just enjoying good conversations, I believe in living life with intention and making the most of every moment.
    Feel free to reach out if you want to talk tech, music, or anything in between!</p>

<p>I'm also a die hard Philly sports fan. Go Eagles, Go Sixers, and in my spare time I fly back to Philly to catch a game at the Linc! Thanks for checking out my website.</p>
